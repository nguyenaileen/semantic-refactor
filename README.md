# semantic-refactor
A case study in refactoring HTML semantics

## Description
Our client runs a digital marketing agency and has a website. They wanted to update their website so it is accessible to screen readers. In order to do this, I edited the HTML to have semantic tags. In doing so, this made changes to the pages layout so I had to go into the CSS to fix the bugs. 

## Problem
The website was already built but it does not meet accessibility guidliens and is poor in SEO because the website does not use semantic HTML tags. 

## Solution
I wrote the HTML tags to be semantic tags. This makes it more accessible and allows screen readers to understand the page better, improving SEO. Some redundincies in the CSS elements were removed in order to clean up the code.
